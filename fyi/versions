      fix(kotlin): classes with newlines (#476)
      
      ## What:
      This PR makes it so we can parse Kotlin classes that have a newline between the class identifier and constructor.
      
      ## Why:
      Parse rate.
      
      ## How:
      The problem is in cases like:
      ```
      class Foo
      constructor Bar() { ... }
      ```
      
      Here, we insert an automatic semicolon between `Foo` and `constructor`. This leaves us able to parse `class Foo` as a `class_declaration`, but `constructor Bar ...` is not allowed on its own.
      
      We simply allow `constructor Bar ...` to be a standalone statement, and resolve to stitch them together at parsing time.
      
      ### Testing
      
      Tested with `make test` and `test-lang kotlin`
      
      ### Security
      
      - [ ] Change has no security implications (otherwise, ping the security team)
